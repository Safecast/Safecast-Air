You will need the following in order to update the firmware:  

Arduino IDE 1.6.11  
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases#previous  
  
Teensy (software for version 3.2)  
https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html  
  
Firmware files  
https://github.com/Safecast/Safecast-Air/tree/master/firmware  
  
For the beta we are specifically using the files from /particulate_only  
  
Look in Arduino preferences and make sure that your Arduino sketchbook location is pointing at the folder on your local drive. Example:
/Users/yourname/Desktop/Safecast-Air-master/firmware/  

Practice  
If you are new to updating Arduino, then please go through this quick tutorial. Start with "Install Arduino" and then practice with the Blink exercise. You will then apply this same logic to upload the Safecast files.
