Teensy board
====================


Take the Teensy header and solder onto the Teensy board as shown in the image below.

The teensy header is the one with two rows of seven pins with flat foot terminals.  Solder it to the Teensy board by placing the board solder side up with the board flat.  Locate the teensy header over the solder pads centering the feet over the pads.  Solder one end terminal to secure the header, check the alignment then reposition if required by reheating the end terminal.  Once the alignment is correct solder the remaining terminals.

Complete the assembly by installing two 14 pin terminals one the sides, 5 pin terminal on the end and finally one modified 5 pin terminal (remove the second pin by simply pulling it out of the assembly) adjacent to the upper most 14 pin terminal in the photo.
